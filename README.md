# Chest X-Ray Diagnosis "Double Check" Web App

## Description
The idea was to build a transfer learning, convolutional neural network model that can take in chest x-ray images and make a prediction regarding the patient's disease state/lack thereof. 

## Use Cases
Doctors could use it as a double check when assessing x-rays. Radiology students could use the app as a learning tool, uploading images they weren't sure about. Potentially, even every day citizens could be empowered by such an app to get a second opinion of their own health status, a major precept of the [patient-data-ownership movement](https://www.aafp.org/news/blogs/freshperspectives/entry/doctor_or_patient_who_owns.html).
